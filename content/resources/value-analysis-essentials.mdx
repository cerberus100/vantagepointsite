## What committees need

### Concise clinical rationale
Two-page summary of clinical problem, device mechanism, patient population, expected outcomes, and supporting evidence. No marketing fluff—just clinical facts.

### Coverage and coding brief
Current CPT/HCPCS codes, DRG assignment, payer coverage policies, reimbursement rates, and any coverage gaps. Committees need reimbursement certainty before approval.

### Economic summary
Cost per case, annual budget impact, cost-offset opportunities, ROI timeline. Include sensitivity analysis for different volume scenarios.

### References and evidence
Peer-reviewed publications, FDA clearance/approval documentation, real-world data, and competitor comparisons. Committees verify claims independently.

### Implementation plan
Timeline, training requirements, supply chain logistics, EMR integration needs, and go-live support. Feasibility matters as much as clinical benefit.

## Common pitfalls

### Overpromising outcomes
Committees see hundreds of submissions. Exaggerated claims trigger skepticism and delay. Stick to what the evidence supports.

### Ignoring reimbursement
Clinical benefit alone doesn't secure approval. If the hospital loses money on every case, the device won't get adopted—no matter how good it is.

### Skipping the champion
Value analysis committees need internal advocates. Without a clinician champion to answer questions and vouch for the device, submissions often stall.

## Submission process

### Pre-submission
Meet with supply chain and clinical stakeholders to understand priorities and concerns. Tailor your dossier to address their specific needs.

### Formal submission
Submit complete dossier through hospital's vendor portal. Follow formatting requirements exactly—incomplete submissions get rejected without review.

### Committee presentation
Expect 15-20 minutes for presentation and Q&A. Bring clinical champion, be ready for tough questions, and provide follow-up materials promptly.

### Post-decision
If approved, coordinate implementation quickly. If denied, request feedback, address concerns, and resubmit when ready. Persistence pays off.
