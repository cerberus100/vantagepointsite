## Decision units

### Clinician (Champion)
**Goals:** Improve patient outcomes, reduce complications, streamline workflow, maintain autonomy.

**Outreach patterns:** Clinical evidence summaries, peer testimonials, CME-eligible content, in-service demonstrations, trial periods.

### Supply chain (Gatekeeper)
**Goals:** Standardize inventory, reduce costs, ensure reliable delivery, minimize SKU proliferation.

**Outreach patterns:** Vendor onboarding documentation, pricing transparency, GPO/IDN alignment, delivery logistics, contract terms.

### Value analysis committee (Evaluator)
**Goals:** Assess clinical benefit, financial impact, implementation feasibility, risk mitigation.

**Outreach patterns:** Structured dossier (clinical rationale, economic model, references, implementation plan), committee presentation, Q&A support.

### Finance (Approver)
**Goals:** ROI justification, budget fit, reimbursement certainty, risk assessment.

**Outreach patterns:** Financial models, reimbursement briefs, budget impact analysis, case studies with cost data.

### IT/EMR (Enabler)
**Goals:** Integration feasibility, data security, workflow compatibility, minimal disruption.

**Outreach patterns:** Technical specifications, EMR order-set templates, interface documentation, implementation timeline.

## Outreach sequencing

### Phase 1: Awareness (Clinician)
Build clinical interest through evidence summaries, webinars, and peer introductions. Goal: secure champion.

### Phase 2: Evaluation (Supply chain + Value analysis)
Provide structured materials for formal review. Goal: committee submission and approval.

### Phase 3: Approval (Finance)
Present economic justification and reimbursement clarity. Goal: budget allocation and contract terms.

### Phase 4: Implementation (IT + Supply chain)
Coordinate technical setup and logistics. Goal: go-live readiness and first case.

## IDN and ASC nuances

### IDN (Integrated Delivery Network)
Multiple facilities require coordinated rollout. Start with flagship hospital, demonstrate success, then expand. Leverage system-wide contracts and shared services.

### ASC (Ambulatory Surgery Center)
Faster decision cycles but tighter economics. Focus on case volume, reimbursement certainty, and scheduling efficiency. Physician-owners often hold dual roles (clinician + finance).
