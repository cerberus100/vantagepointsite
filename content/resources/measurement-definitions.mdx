## What we track

### Meetings booked and show rate
Total meetings scheduled with qualified accounts, and the percentage that actually occur. Tracks outreach effectiveness and account engagement quality.

### Qualified meetings (meets ICP + intent)
Meetings with accounts matching ideal customer profile criteria and demonstrating genuine interest. Separates tire-kickers from serious prospects.

### Value analysis submissions
Number of formal submissions to hospital value analysis committees. Indicates progression from interest to formal evaluation stage.

### EMR order-set requests/activations
Requests for electronic medical record integration and actual activations. Shows commitment to workflow adoption and operational readiness.

### Contracting stage progression
Movement through contracting phases (initial discussion, terms negotiation, legal review, signature). Tracks deal velocity and identifies bottlenecks.

### First PO date
Time from initial contact to first purchase order. Key metric for sales cycle length and program efficiency.

## Why these matter

### Leading vs. lagging indicators
These metrics predict future revenue before it appears in your CRM. They help you course-correct early, not after quarters are lost.

### Denominators matter
We track not just raw counts but rates: show rate, qualification rate, submission-to-contract rate. This reveals where your funnel leaks.

### Benchmarking and iteration
With clear definitions, you can compare across programs, reps, and time periods. What worked in Q1? What changed in Q2? Data tells the story.
