# Patient pathways

Make it easy for clinics to educate patients and move them through scheduling and follow-up—focused on clarity, not claims.

## Who it's for

Clinic operations leads and care teams adopting a new device-supported pathway.

## What we deliver

- Plain-language patient info sheets and scheduling scripts
- Prep and after-visit summaries aligned to clinic workflow
- Simple tracking sheets for adherence/follow-up reminders
- Content handoff to your team for branding/legal review

## How we partner

Target stakeholders → align processes → ship materials → iterate with feedback

## Outcomes we target

Prepared visits • Fewer reschedules • Higher adherence to follow-ups
