# HCP education programs

Concise education that builds awareness and answers what clinicians and admins need to proceed—without hands-on training.

## Who it's for

Clinicians and administrators evaluating a coded device for their setting (hospital, IDN, ASC, large group).

## What we deliver

- Evidence digest (plain-language summary with references)
- Indications/contraindications overview and workflow implications
- Documentation & coverage checklist for evaluators
- Short micro-explainers (3–5 min) and office-hour format
- EMR request template (order-set/smart phrase) to reduce friction

## How we partner

**Target → Access → Educate → Launch → Measure** (same as Field enablement; tailored to education assets)

## Outcomes we target

Module/comms engagement • In-service/office-hour attendance • EMR request submissions • Meeting conversions
