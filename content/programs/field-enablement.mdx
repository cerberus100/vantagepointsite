# Field enablement

Equip your team to reach the right decision units and turn interest into scheduled meetings—then hand off cleanly to sales.

## Who it's for

Device companies with coded products that want hospital/IDN/ASC adoption without expanding a field force.

## What we deliver

- Buyer briefs for clinicians, supply chain, value analysis, finance
- Outreach sequences (email + LinkedIn) with talk tracks and objection handling
- Meeting kit: agenda, discovery prompts, qualification criteria
- Handoff SOP: notes template, next-step matrix, intro email copy
- Light enablement assets: evaluator one-pager, product knowledge sheet
- Calendar and routing patterns for fast scheduling

## How we partner

- **Target** — account list by site-of-care and decision unit
- **Access** — value analysis dossier outline, coding/coverage summary
- **Educate** — product knowledge briefs and evaluator one-pagers
- **Launch** — compliant outreach, scheduling, warm handoffs
- **Measure** — meetings booked, qualified meetings, VAC submissions, first PO date

## Outcomes we target (leading indicators)
